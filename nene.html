	<h2>About Nene Kinokuni:</h2>
	<p>Nene Kinokuni is the current 8th seat in the Totsuki Council of 10.</p>
	<p>Nene is an average looking girl with pink eyes and large circular glasses.</p>
	<p>Nene Kinokuni is a 91st Totsuki Generation student.</p>
	<h2>Characteristics about Nene Kinokuni:</h2>
	<p>Nene is extremely taciturn, speaking very bluntly if she even speaks at all.<p/>
	<p>Her personality directly conflicts with Terunori Kuga, who is much more loud</p>
	<p>and brash, often leading to her to vocally tell him to die or ridiculing his height.</p>
	<p>Like most of the other Elite Ten members, Nene does not see any of the first year</p>
	<p>students as a threat due to the confidence her superior abilities that got her the seat.</p>
	<p>Nene is the daughter of the prestigious Kinokuni family and was trained from an early age</p>
	<p>in various Japanese customs from dance, caligraphy, judo, and even using a naginata.</p>
	<p>As per the tradition of the Isshiki family, their heir is sent to another family to </p>
	<p>hone their skills.</p>
	<p>The current heir, Satoshi Isshiki, was sent to the Kinokuni family where he lived with Nene and her family.</p>
	<p>While his methods and tactics to gather clients can be questionable, it is undeniable</p>
	<p>Though she was happy to interact with someone her age at the suggestion of her father,</p>
	<p>she quickly became frustrated when she saw Satoshi effortlessly learn nearly all skills</p>
	<p>taught to her in a short period of time.</p>
