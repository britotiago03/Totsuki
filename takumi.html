	<h1>About Takumi Aldini</h1>
	<img src="Images/takumi.png" width="500" height="300">
	<p>Takumi Aldini is the current 7th seat in the Totsuki Council of 10.</p>
	<p>Hailing from Italy, Takumi is the self-proclaimed rival of Sōma Yukihira.</p>
	<p>Takumi Aldini is a 92nd Totsuki Generation student and the elder twin brother of</p>
	<p>Isami Aldini.</p>
	<h1>Characteristics about Akira Hayama:</h1>
	<p>Takumi has blue eyes and short blonde hair with a fringe that parts to both sides</p>
	<p>and one long bang in between the two.</p>
	<p>Takumi is a hot-blooded student who holds a strong rivalry with Sōma Yukihira, though</p>
	<p>this rivalry is somewhat one-sided with Takumi pursuing this rivalry much more intensely than Soma</p>
	<p>Like Soma, he hails from a family owned restaurant, which he holds with pride and will</p>
	<p>defend its name when a challenge presents itself.</p>
	<p>Takumi hates to lose and is rather bitter in defeat, he is also easily flustered and embarrassed</p>
	<p>when he makes a mistake or when someone glazes over his declarations.</p>
	<p>He also speaks Italian and has his own catchphrase, "buon appetito" for someone who is going to eat</p>
	<p>his dish and "grazie" for someone who has just finished eating his dish.</p>
