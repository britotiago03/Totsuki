	<h1>About Ryo Kurokiba</h1>
	<img src="Images/ryo.png" width="500" height="300">
	<p>Ryo Kurokiba is the current 5th seat in the Totsuki Council of 10.</p>
	<p>Ryo is quite tall and has a well-built body, his notable traits include </p>
	<p>his long, unkempt brownish black hair and bangs that framed his face</p>
	<p>Ryo Kurokiba is a 92nd Totsuki Generation student and Alice Nakiri's aide.</p>
	<h1>Characteristics about Ryo Kurokiba:</h1>
	<p>For the most part, Ryo is normally very slow, lazy, and gloomy. His general</p>
	<p>demeanor lacks any sort of interest on what is going on around him, but he </p>
	<p>remains attentive to the needs of Alice.</p>
	<p>He is not shy to speak his own mind or criticize Alice in this form, but generally</p>
	<p>will only speak when necessary if he is with anyone but Alice.</p>
	<p>Because of the bond the two formed in their youth, Ryo is obedient to Alice's requests</p>
	<p>and protects her from any sort of threats.</p>
	<p>However, Ryo has a much more passionate personality that only emerges once he wears his</p>
	<p>signature bandana or any sort of tight fitting headgear like a swim cap.</p>
	<p>This new demeanor is much bolder, wilder, and untamed, akin to a wild beast, fittingly called</p>
	<p>his "Berserk Mode", according to Alice.</p>
