	<h1>About Etsuya Eizan</h1>
	<img src="Images/etsuya.png" width="500" height="300">
	<p>Etsuya Eizan is the current 8th seat in the Totsuki Council of 10.</p>
	<p>He is nicknamed the Alchemist.</p>
	<p>Etsuya Eizan is a 91st Totsuki Generation student.</p>
	<h1>Characteristics about Etsuya Eizan:</h1>
	<p>Eizan is described by Satoshi Isshiki to be a Yankee, having a large force of<p/>
	<p>delinquent boys behind him to do his dirty work.</p>
	<p>He is a slick businessman, being a well known, but somewhat underground, business</p>
	<p>consultant since his middle school days, charging a large monthly fee for his services.</p>
	<p>He has had this mindset since middle school, having applied to Totsuki to make money.</p>
	<p>While his methods and tactics to gather clients can be questionable, it is undeniable</p>
	<p>that his charisma and presentation can instantly turn anyone, even a former business rival,</p>
	<p>into a prospective client. </p>
	<p>However, Eizan can be extremely cruel, heartless, and frequently employs dirty tactics to</p>
	<p>prove a point, such as rigging the 43rd Annual Tōtsuki Autumn Election matchups to have one</p>
	<p>of his enforcers, Subaru Mimasaka, challenge both Takumi Aldini and Sōma Yukihira in the tournament.</p>
